# Hunt-The-Wumpus
###Setup
* The size of the grid representing the cave network must be 7 x 7 and must be represented internally by a
2D array.
* Each cell on the grid represents a room in the cave and adjacent rooms are connected through doors
which open North, South, East, or West. NOTE: These directions are only valid as long as the player is
trying to move to an adjacent room, NOT off the edge of the grid.
* The map should be randomly populated with the following items and no two items can occupy the same
room:
◦ 2 Bats
◦ 2 Bottomless Pits
◦ 1 Wumpus
◦ 2 Extra Arrows
* The player should be randomly dropped into any empty room to start the game, and has an initial arrow
capacity of 5.
* The map is hidden from the player initially.
